- Chapter 02: Highlights
    - When you design a class, a think about the objects that will be created from that class type. Think about:
        - things the object knows
        - things the object does
    - Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables
    - Things an object can do are called methods
    - A class is a blueprint for an object.
    - The two uses of main:
        - to test your real class
        - to launch/start your Java application
    - A real Java application is nothing but objects talking to other objects. In this case, talking means objects calling methods on one another.
    - Each time an object is created in Java, it goes into an area of memory known as The Heap.
    - The Java heap is actually called the Garbage- Collectible Heap.
    - When the JVM can “see” that an object can never be used again, that object becomes eligible for garbage collection.
    - Q: What if I need global variables and methods? How do I do that if everything has to go in a class?
        - In Java, there is no direct concept of "global" variables and methods within the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
            - However, to achieve similar functionality:
                - You can declare a method (or constant) as public and static to make it accessible from anywhere in your program.
                - This mimics a "global" behavior, enabling any code in any part of your program to call a public static method.
                - If you declare a variable as public, static, and final, you effectively create a globally accessible constant.
    - Q: Then how is this object oriented if you can still make global functions and global data?
        - In Java, everything, including global-like functions and data, is organized within classes.
        - While you can create public and static methods and variables that seem "global," they are typically exceptions in Java's object-oriented paradigm.
        - These static elements, such as the constant for pi and the random() method, are defined within specific classes like Math.
        - It's important to note that these global-like, static features are exceptions in Java and do not involve multiple instances or objects; they represent a special case within the object-oriented model.
    - Q: What is a Java program? What do you actually deliver?
        - A Java program is essentially a collection of classes, typically with at least one class containing a main method, which serves as the entry point for the program.
        - As a programmer, your primary task is to create one or more classes, and these classes are what you deliver as part of your Java application.
        - When distributing your Java application, you may also need to include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) if the end user does not already have it installed.
        - Various tools and programs allow you to package your classes along with the JVM and create a distributable folder or file that can be shared, for instance, via the internet.
        - This enables the end user to install the required version of the JVM (if not already present on their machine) in order to run your Java program.
    - Q: What if I have a hundred classes? Or a thousand? Isn't that a big pain to deliver all those individual files? Can I bundle them into one Application Thing?
        - When you have a large number of classes (e.g., a hundred or a thousand), delivering them as individual files would indeed be cumbersome for end users.
        - To simplify distribution, you can bundle all your application files into a Java Archive (JAR) file, which is based on the pkzip format.
        - Inside the JAR file, you can include a simple text file formatted as a "manifest." This manifest file specifies which class within the JAR contains the main() method that should be executed when the program runs.
        - Using a JAR file and a manifest makes it much more convenient to package and distribute your Java application.
- Chapter 02: Summary
    - Object-oriented programming lets you extend a program without having to touch previously tested, working code.
    - All Java code is defined in a class.
    - A class describes how to make an object of that class type. A class is like a blueprint.
    - An object can take care of itself; you don’t have to know or care how the object does it.
    - An object knows things and does things.
    - Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables. They represent the state of an object.
    - Things an object does are called methods. They represent the behavior of an object.
    - When you create a class, you may also want to create a separate test class which you’ll use to create objects of your new class type.
    - A class can inherit instance variables and methods from a more abstract superclass.
    - At runtime, a Java program is nothing more than objects ‘talking’ to other objects.
