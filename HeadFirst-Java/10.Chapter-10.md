## Numbers Matter: numbers and statics 

### Chapter 10: Highlights
- Methods in the Math class don't use any instance variable values. And because the methods are "static,* you don't need to have an instance of Math. All you need is the Math class.
- The keyword static lets a method run without any instance of the class. A static method means “behavior not dependent on an instance variable, so no instance/object is required. Just the class.”
- Call a static method using a class name
- Call a non-static method using a reference variable name
- If you try to use an instance variable from a inside a static method, the compiler thinks, "I don't know which object's instance variable you're talking about!" If you have ten Duck objects on the heap, a static method doesn't know about any of them.
- Static methods can't use non-static methods, either!
- Q: What if you try to call a non-static method from a static method, but the non-static method doesn't use any instance variables. Will the compiler allow that? 
    - A: No, the compiler will not allow it. Regardless of whether a non-static method uses instance variables or not, the compiler prohibits calling non-static methods from static methods. Allowing such a scenario could lead to issues when modifying the implementation of the non-static method in the future or when a subclass overrides the method and uses an instance variable in the overriding version.
- Q: I could swear I've seen code that calls a static method using a reference variable instead of the class name.
    - A: Yes, it's possible to call a static method using a reference variable, but it's not considered good practice. While legal, it makes the code less readable. The compiler resolves the call to the actual class, treating it as if the class name were used directly. Using a reference variable to invoke a static method doesn't imply that the method will have any special knowledge of the object that the reference variable is referencing—it's simply an alternate way to invoke a static method, and the method remains static.
- Static variable: value is the same for ALL instances of the class
- Static variables are shared. All instances of the same class share a single copy of the static variables. instance variables: 1 per instance static variables: 1 per class
- Static variables in a class are initialized before any object of that class can be created.
- Static variables in a class are initialized before any static method of the class runs.
- static final variables are constants
- A static initializer is a block of code that runs when a class is loaded, before any other code can use the class, so it's a great place to initialize a static final variable.
- Initialize a final static variable:
    - At the time you declare it:
    - In a static initializer:
    - If you don't give a value to a final variable you will get an error
- A final variable means you can't change its value.
- A final method means you can't override the method.
- A final class means you can't extend the class (i.e., you can't make a subclass).
- Q: A static method can't access a non-static variable. But can a non-static method access a static variable? 
    - A: Yes, a non-static method can always access a static variable or call a static method within the same class.
- Q: Why would I want to make a class final? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of OOP?
    - A: Making a class final is not always against the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is done for security reasons. For instance, making a class like String final prevents someone from creating a subclass of String and potentially causing issues by substituting their own subclass objects where String objects are expected. If you need to ensure a specific implementation of the methods in a class, making the class final provides that guarantee.
- Q: Isn't it redundant to have to mark the methods final if the class is final?
    - A: If the class is final, marking the methods as final is not necessary. In a final class, none of its methods can be overridden since the class itself cannot be subclassed. However, if you want to allow others to extend your class while selectively preventing the override of certain methods, you can leave the class non-final and mark specific methods as final. This way, a subclass can't override the marked methods, providing a level of control over the extensibility of your class.
- When you need to treat a primitive like an object, wrap it.
- Java will Autobox primitives for you
- Autoboxing works almost everywhere
    - Method arguments
    - Return values
    - Boolean expressions
    - Operations on numbers

### Chapter 10: Summary
- A static method should be called using the class name rather than an object reference variable: Math.random() versus myFoo.go() 
- A static method can be invoked without any instances of the method’s class on the heap.
- A static method is good for a utility method that does not (and will never) depend on a particular instance variable value.
- A static method is not associated with a particular instance—only the class—so it cannot access any instance variable values of its class. It wouldn’t know which instance’s values to use.
- A static method cannot access a non-static method, since non-static methods are usually associated with instance variable state.
- If you have a class with only static methods and you do not want the class to be instantiated, you can mark the constructor private.
- A static variable is a variable shared by all members of a given class. There is only one copy of a static variable in a class, rather than one copy per each object for instance variables.
- A static method can access a static variable.
- To make a constant in Java, mark a variable as both static and final.
- A final static variable must be assigned a value either at the time it is declared or in a static initializer: static { DOG_CODE = 420; } 
- The naming convention for constants (final static variables) is to make the name all uppercase and use underscores (_) to separate the words.
- A final variable value cannot be changed once it has been assigned.
- Assigning a value to a final instance variable must be either at the time it is declared or in the constructor.
- A final method cannot be overridden.
- A final class cannot be extended (subclassed).
