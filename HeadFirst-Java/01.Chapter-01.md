        -   Speed and memory usage
            -   When Java was first released, it was slow. But soon after, the HotSpot VM was created, as were other performance enhancers. While it's true that Java isn't the fastest language out there, it's considered to be a very fast language almost as fast as languages like C and Rust, and much faster than most other languages out there.
            -   Java has a magic super-power the JVM. The Java Virtual Machine can optimize your code while it's running, so it's possible to create very fast applications without having to write specialized high-performance code.
            -   But full disclosure compared to C and Rust, Java uses a lot of memory.
        -   Anatomy of a Java Class
            -   The anatomy of a Java class typically consists of several components that define its structure and behavior. Here's an overview of the key elements you'll find in a Java class:
                -   1. **Class Declaration:**
                    -   A Java class begins with the declaration of the class name. For example:
                        -   ```java
                            public class MyClass {
                            ```
                            
                        -   The public keyword indicates that the class is accessible from other classes. The class name should start with an uppercase letter and match the file name.
                -   2. **Fields (Instance Variables):**
                    -   Fields represent the data or state of the class. They are also known as instance variables.
                    -   Fields are declared within the class and can have various access modifiers, such as private, protected, or public.
                    -   ```java
                        private int myField;
                        ```
                        
                -   3. **Constructors:**
                    -   Constructors are special methods used to create and initialize objects of the class. They have the same name as the class and can take parameters.
                    -   ```java
                        public MyClass(int initialValue) {
                            myField = initialValue;
                        }
                        ```
                        
                -   4. **Methods:**
                    -   Methods define the behavior or operations that the class can perform.
                    -   Methods are declared within the class and can also have various access modifiers.
                    -   ```java
                        public void doSomething() {
                            // Method implementation
                        }
                        ```
                        
                -   5. **Main Method (optional):**
                    -   The main method serves as the entry point for Java applications.
                    -   It should have the following signature:
                        -   ```java
                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                                // Application logic
                            }
                            ```
                            
                -   6. **Access Modifiers:**
                    -   Access modifiers like public, private, and protected control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields and methods).
                -   7. **Inheritance (optional):**
                    -   Java supports inheritance, allowing one class to inherit fields and methods from another class. This is achieved using the extends keyword.
                    -   ```java
                        public class SubClass extends SuperClass {
                            // Subclass members
                        }
                        ```
                        
                -   8. **Interfaces (optional):**
                    -   Java supports interfaces, which define a contract for classes that implement them. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
                    -   ```java
                        public class MyClass implements MyInterface {
                            // Class members
                        }
                        ```
                        
                -   9. **Annotations (optional):**
                    -   Annotations provide metadata and additional information about classes and their members.
                    -   ```java
                        @Override
                        public void someMethod() {
                            // Annotation usage
                        }
                        ```
                        
                -   10. **Inner Classes (optional):**
                    -   Java allows you to define classes within other classes. These are called inner or nested classes.
                    -   ```java
                        public class OuterClass {
                            class InnerClass {
                                // Inner class members
                            }
                        }
                        ```
                        
            -   These components collectively define the structure, state, and behavior of a Java class, making it a fundamental building block in object-oriented programming.
        -   Code structure in Java
            -   In a source file, put a class. In a class, put methods. In a method, put statements.
            -   **Source File:**
                -   Contains a single class definition (Java extension).
                -   The class represents a portion of your program, even a small application may have just one class.
                -   The class is enclosed within curly braces.
            -   **Class:**
                -   Contains one or more methods.
                -   For instance, in a Dog class, the bark method provides instructions for how the Dog should bark.
                -   Methods must be declared inside the class, within its curly braces.
            -   **Method:**
                -   Instructions for how a specific task or function should be executed.
                -   Method code consists of a set of statements.
                -   Conceptually, a method is similar to a function or procedure.
        -   JVM Vs Compiler
            -   **Compiler:**
                -   1. **Source Code**: The process begins with the creation of Java source code files. These files contain the program's instructions and are written by developers in a human-readable form.
                -   2. **Compilation**: The source code is passed to a compiler. The compiler is a software tool that translates the high-level Java source code into a lower-level intermediate form called bytecode. During this process, the compiler checks the source code for syntax and semantic errors. If errors are found, the compilation process will be halted, and the developer must fix them before proceeding.
                -   3. **Bytecode**: The compiler generates bytecode, which is a platform-independent representation of the program. Bytecode is not specific to any hardware or operating system, making it portable.
                -   4. **Class Files**: The compiled bytecode is saved in .class files, each corresponding to a class defined in the source code.
            -   **Java Virtual Machine (JVM):**
                -   1. **Class Loading**: When you want to run a Java program, you don't execute the .java source file directly. Instead, you execute the .class files. The JVM is responsible for loading these .class files into memory.
                -   2. **Bytecode Verification**: The JVM performs bytecode verification to ensure that the loaded bytecode is safe to execute and doesn't violate any security constraints. This step is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the Java environment.
                -   3. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: At runtime, the JVM translates the bytecode into machine code that is specific to the host system on which it is running. This process is called JIT compilation. The machine code is executed directly by the CPU, which improves the performance of the Java program. JIT compilation is also responsible for adapting the code to the host system's architecture, optimizing it for better execution speed.
                -   4. **Execution**: The JVM executes the machine code, which corresponds to the original Java program. It manages memory, handles exceptions, and provides runtime support for features like garbage collection and multithreading. The program runs within the JVM environment, making it platform-independent.
                -   5. **Garbage Collection**: The JVM includes a garbage collector that automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer in use. This helps in managing memory efficiently and preventing memory leaks.
                -   6. **Platform Independence**: One of the key advantages of the JVM is its ability to run Java programs on any system that has a compatible JVM installed. This platform independence is achieved by the separation of bytecode from the specific hardware and operating system.
            -   In summary, the compiler translates high-level Java source code into bytecode, which is a platform-independent representation of the program. The JVM, on the other hand, is responsible for loading and executing these bytecode files, adapting them to the host system, and providing essential runtime support. Together, the compiler and JVM enable the "write once, run anywhere" principle of Java.
        -   Q: Why does everything have to be in a class?
            -   A: Java is an object-oriented (OO) language. It's not like the old days when you had steam-driven compilers and wrote one monolithic source file with a pile of procedures. In Chapter 2, "A Trip to Objectville," you'll learn that a class is a blueprint for an object, and that nearly everything in Java is an object.
        -   Q: Do I have to put a main in every class I write?
            -   A: Nope. A Java program might use dozens of classes (even hundreds), but you might only have one with a main method—the one that starts the program running.
        -   Q: In my other language, I can do a boolean test on an integer. In Java, can I say something like:
            -   ```
                int x;
                while (x) { }
                ```
                
            -   A: No. A boolean and an integer are not compatible types in Java. Since the result of a conditional test must be a boolean, the only variable you can directly test (without using a comparison operator) is a boolean. For example, you can say:
                -   ```
                    boolean isHot = true;
                    while (isHot) { }
                    ```
                    
    -   Chapter 01: Summary
        -   Statements end in a semicolon: ;
        -   Code blocks are defined by a pair of curly braces: {}
        -   Declare an int variable with a name and a type: int x
        -   The assignment operator is one equals sign: =
        -   The equals operator uses two equals signs: ==
        -   A while loop runs everything within its block (defined by curly braces) as long as the conditional test is true.
        -   If the conditional test is fa1se, the while loop code block won't run, and execution will move down to the code immediately after the loop block.
        -   Put a boolean test inside parentheses: while (x == 4) {}
        -   Your Java program should start with a high level design.
        -   Typically you'll write three things when you create a new class: prepcode, testcode, real (Java) code.
        -   Prepcode should describe what to do, not how to do it. Implementation comes later.
        -   Use the prepcode to help design the test code.
        -   Write test code before you implement the methods. How many hits did you get last month?
        -   Choose for loops over while loops when you know how many times you want to repeat the loop code.
        -   Use the pre/post increment operator to add 1 to avariable: x++;
        -   Use the pre/post decrement to subtract 1 from a variable: x--;
        -   Use Integer.parseInt() to get the int value of a String.
        -   Integer.parseInt() works only if the String represents a digit ("0", "1", "2", etc.).
        -   Use break to leave a loop early (i.e. even if the boolean test condition is still true).
