- ArrayList is a class in the Java API.
- To put something into an ArrayList, use add().
- To remove something from an ArrayList use remove().
- To find out where something is (and if it is) in an ArrayList, use indexOf().
- To find out if an ArrayList is empty, use isEmpty(). 
- To get the size (number of elements) in an ArrayList, use the size() method.
- To get the length (number of elements) in a regular old array, remember, you use the length variable. 
- An ArrayList resizes dynamically to whatever size needed. It grows when objects are added, and it shrinks when objects are removed.
- You declare the type of the array using a type parameter, which is a type name in angle brackets. Example: ArrayList<Button> means the ArrayList will be able (O hold only objects of type Button (or subclasses of Button.
- Although an ArrayList holds objects and not primitives, the compiler will automatically "wrap" (and 'un- wrap" when you take it out) a primitive into an Object and place that object in the ArrayList instead of the primitive.
- Classes are grouped into packages. 
- A class has a full name, which is a combination of the package name and the class name. Class ArrayList is really java.util.ArrayList.
- To use a class in a package other than java lang, you must tell Java the full name of the class.
- You can either use an import statement at the top of your source code, or you can type the full name every place you use the class in your code.
